'''
Naming of the plots:
- without agressive: the initial Balthazar's distiction between always retreating or sometimes attempting to fight, 
and never really attempting to show off (because cost of fight always deduced)
- with agressive: adding "agressive" type which is kind of third layer, it always fights, 
but the "show-off" also fights, no distinction between bluff and fight
- with agressive sophisticated: distinction between bluffing and fighting is introduced, no cost involved in bluffing, 1/2 chance of winning,
cost involved in fighting, same chance of winning, if other agent is agressive, you'd have to fight with prob 1/2
- with agressive constant win False: all the same as for "with agressive sophisticated", add conditioning the probability of
winning the fight on the energy of the crews
- with aggressive ... energies - go to Type plot conditioned
- with aggressive ... cB num - with cost of bluff at the level of num
